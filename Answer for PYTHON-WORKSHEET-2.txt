Ans: A, C and D

Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11.  Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

Ans:
list: Insertion order is preserved and duplicates are allowed, heterogeneous in nature and values should be enclosed with [].
Tuple: Insertion order is preserved and duplicates are allowed, heterogeneous in nature, immutability in nature and values should be enclosed with ().
Set: Insertion order is not preserved and duplicates are not allowed, indexing/slicing is not applicable and values should be enclosed with {}.
Dictionary: A dictionary is a group of keyvalue pair which is similar to an array found in other programming languages. 

12.  Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, 
write a small code to replace ‘+’
with space in python.

Ans: 
Yes, strings are mutable in python. PFB code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.
before_str="I+Love+Python" 
after_replace=string.replace('+',' ')
print("String after replacing spaces insted of + :", after_replace)

13.  What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, 
write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.

Ans:
The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.PFB example.
print("The ASCII value of A is",ord('A')), here the output will come the ASCII value of A, which is 65.
print("The ASCII value of a is",ord('a')), here the output will come the ASCII value of a, which is 97.

We are using the type() function to find the datatype of any variable in python.

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

14.  Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥² + 
𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be 
equal to 0.

Ans:
# Python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. 
# Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. 
# Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.
# So, lets import complex math module  

import cmath  
a = float(input('Enter a: '))  
b = float(input('Enter b: '))  
c = float(input('Enter c: '))  
  
# calculate the discriminant  
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)  
  
# find the two solutions  
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
print('The solution of quadratic equation are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))

suppose the input are, a=3,b=3,c=3, then the solution of quadratic equation are (-0.5-0.8660254037844387j) and (-0.5+0.8660254037844387j).

15.  Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers 
without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‘n’.

Ans:
# Python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop.
# Ask user to input the value of ‘n’.

number = float(input('Enter a number: ')) 
sum_of_numbers=number * (number + 1) / 2
print("sum of first", number , "natural numbers is:",sum_of_numbers)

The output will be, if the number is: 5, then the output of sum of first 5.0 natural numbers is: 15.0
