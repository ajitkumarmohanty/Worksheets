Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type question. Answer them briefly.

11. Describe the basic architecture of a CNN?

Ans: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. 
Convolutional Neural Networks are state of the art models for Image Classification, Segmentation, Object Detection and many other image processing tasks.

12. What is convolution in CNN? What is the role of convolution in image processing?

Ans: The term convolution refers to the mathematical combination of two functions to produce a third function. It merges two sets of information. 
In the case of a CNN, the convolution is performed on the input data with the use of a filter or kernel (these terms are used interchangeably) 
to then produce a feature map.

13. What is the difference between Max Pooling and Average Pooling? Explain briefly.

Ans: Average pooling method smooths out the image and hence the sharp features may not be identified when this pooling method is used. 
Max pooling selects the brighter pixels from the image. It is useful when the background of the image is dark and we are interested in 
only the lighter pixels of the image.

14. What is Padding? Why is it used?

Ans: The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined 
margins and/or borders. Padding values are set using lengths or percentages, and cannot accept negative values. The initial, or default, value for 
all padding properties is 0. The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. 
With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

15. Describe the layers used in classification part of a CNN?

Ans: There are three types of layers in a convolutional neural network: convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer.
Fully connected layers are placed before the classification output of a CNN and are used to flatten the results before classification. 
This is similar to the output layer of an MLP.
