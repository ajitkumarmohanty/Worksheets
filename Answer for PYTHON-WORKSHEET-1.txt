Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

11.  Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.

Ans: 
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)

Enter a number: -1
Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers

12.  Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.

Ans: 
num = int(input("Enter any number : "))
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is NOT a PRIME number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a PRIME number")
elif num == 0 or 1:
    print(num, "is a neither PRIME nor COMPOSITE number")
else:
    print(num, "is a COMPOSITE number")

Enter any number : 9
9 is NOT a PRIME number

13.  Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
Ans:
my_str = input("Enter any string :")
my_str = my_str.casefold()
rev_str = reversed(my_str)
# check if the string is equal to its reverse
if list(my_str) == list(rev_str):
   print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
   print("The string is not a palindrome.")

Enter any string :ctc
The string is a palindrome.

14.  Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides.
Ans: 
from math import sqrt
print("Input lengths of shorter triangle sides:")
a = float(input("Enter a: "))
b = float(input("Enter b: "))
c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
print("The length of the third side/hypotenuse of right-angled triangle is", c )

Input lengths of shorter triangle sides:
Enter a: 6
Enter b: 7
The length of the third side/hypotenuse of right-angled triangle is 9.219544457292887

15.  Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.
Ans:
my_str = input("Enter any string :")
all_freq = {}   
for i in my_str: 
    if i in all_freq: 
        all_freq[i] += 1
    else: 
        all_freq[i] = 1
print ("Frequency of each characters present in the string is :\n "+  str(all_freq))

Enter any string :bfhdwbd26524bdkjashfjbvs
Frequency of each characters present in the string is :
 {'b': 4, 'f': 2, 'h': 2, 'd': 3, 'w': 1, '2': 2, '6': 1, '5': 1, '4': 1, 'k': 1, 'j': 2, 'a': 1, 's': 2, 'v': 1}
